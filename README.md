## REMINDERS!

- "command.txt" file includes the list of input commands for your java program and it has to be inside the same folder with "cop.py" script.
- Do NOT forget to run scripts in order (first .ahk script then .py) - After 5 seconds delay, the process will be started.
- Do NOT forget to click the java console that you've just executed, before start of the process.
- If there occurs an unexpected problem at runtime, try to change parameter of "time.sleep(0.2)" method (in the line 14 of ".py" script).
